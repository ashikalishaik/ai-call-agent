# OpenAI Realtime API - BACKUP (Old Version)
# This file contains the original OpenAI implementation
# Now using Deepgram for free STT/TTS - see app.py
# Kept for reference only

# Original implementation with OpenAI Realtime API
# Features:
# - Speech-to-Text with OpenAI
# - Text-to-Speech with OpenAI
# - Redis conversation caching
# - Email notifications
# - Appointment detection
# - Daily wrap-up emails

# NOTE: This version is no longer in use.
# The app now runs on Deepgram with $200 free credits
# for unlimited voice conversion instead of paying $0.30/minute to OpenAI.

# See DEEPGRAM_SETUP_GUIDE.md for migration details.
# To restore this version, rename app_openai_backup.py to app.py
